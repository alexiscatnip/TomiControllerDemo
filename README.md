# TomiControllerDemo
Once upon a time, some people tried to make tomibot - a robot that sits on a robotic base, that sprays disinfectant using a spraygun mounted on a PTZ hardware. 
- This repo include some logic to command the spray gun and talking to the robot base over REST.
- Even the REST API part is just an abstraction lol. I never did get any docs about the API.
